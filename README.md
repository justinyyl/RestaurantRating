# Restaurant rating

## Project ideaï¼š
A restaurant rating application to serve restaurant bloggers, restaurant customers and all food lovers.
As a food lover, I know the importance of finding quality restaurants and dining experiences. 
I hope to be able to share my dining experience with others,
I also need a detailed rating system to help me decide whether to dine at a certain restaurant.<br>

Enter the name of a restaurant to view the restaurant's current ratings.
and rate the restaurant based on its **dishes** and **environment**.
Possible features include:
- Rate dishes based on taste, appearance and quality

# Phase 4: Task 3

- I may separate RestaurantRating class into three distinct classes, namely AppUI, Restaurant, and DishUI. 
  The prevailing issue with the extant RestaurantRating class lies in its excessive complexity, 
  compounded by the user interface (UI) architecture it constructs across three distinct panels: ResApp, Restaurant, 
  and Dish. Notably, the functionalities within each panel are relatively autonomous. Consequently, I propose the 
  partitioning of this class into three discrete entities. This restructuring facilitates enhanced modularity and 
  ease of future enhancements to individual components.
- I may also create a View Interface in UI package, since the I separate the RestaurantRating class.
  In this condition, each class in UI package will has a view method. In this way, I can increase readability and 
  reduce coupling.
